Summary
The Shannon River Basin—Ireland’s largest catchment—faces recurring floods and periodic water-quality issues (e.g., turbidity spikes, algal blooms). Your challenge is to develop a digital solution that forecasts flood risk and water quality variations by integrating satellite Earth observation (EO) data (e.g., Sentinel-1 SAR for flood extent, Sentinel-2 for turbidity/algal proxies), ground sensors (river level/flow, turbidity), and weather/river forecasts. Build a web or mobile app (or other creative tool) that visualizes current conditions, predicts short-term risks, alerts users when thresholds are exceeded, and is designed so the same approach can be applied to river basins worldwide.

Background
Flooding and degraded water quality affect public safety, ecosystems, agriculture, tourism, and infrastructure. Radar satellites can map floods through clouds and at night, while optical imagery can indicate sediment loads and algal-risk conditions. Gauges and probes provide real-time ground truth, and weather/river forecasts add predictive power. Today these data streams are fragmented; integrated, user-focused tools can turn raw measurements into actionable insight—supporting emergency response, catchment management, and community awareness in the Shannon and beyond.

Objectives
Build an application that fuses EO, in-situ, and forecast data to:
	•	Display near real-time conditions (e.g., inundation layers, at-risk reaches; turbidity/algal-risk maps).
	•	Generate short-term forecasts (hours–days) of flood likelihood and water-quality changes.
	•	Validate/compare satellite outputs with local gauges and probes.
	•	Alert users (residents, farmers, councils, responders) with clear thresholds and messaging.
	•	Document data sources and methods so the approach is transferable to other basins.

What capabilities will you include? For example, your tool could:
	•	Display and integrate data from diverse sources
• Sentinel-1 flood extent (check latest products)
• Sentinel-2 water-quality proxies (turbidity/chlorophyll indices)
• River level/flow and water-quality sensors
• Weather and river-flow forecasts
	•	Compare satellite outputs with ground sensors for real-time validation
	•	Produce localized forecasts and uncertainty bands
	•	Visualize complex information clearly (maps, timelines, thresholds, plain-language summaries)
	•	Alert users proactively (SMS/email/in-app) about flood or water-quality risks
	•	Provide historical trends and simple “what-if” rainfall scenarios

Whatever you build, prioritize user-centric design for your chosen audience(s). Be explicit about data provenance and limitations. Consider cloud-friendly pipelines for scalable processing and collaboration.

Potential Considerations

Health- & Community-Sensitive Users
	•	Residents in flood-prone areas needing timely, plain-language alerts
	•	Schools, care facilities, and community groups planning activities around water conditions
